- [] Version Control: Set up a Git repository to store your code. Use a service like GitHub or GitLab for hosting and collaboration.

-[] Code Organization: Ensure your Angular app and Django backend are in separate directories within the repository. This allows for easier management and deployment.

- [] Continuous Integration: Select a CI/CD platform that integrates well with your version control system. Popular choices include Jenkins, CircleCI, and GitLab CI/CD. Configure your CI/CD platform to trigger builds whenever changes are pushed to the repository.

- [] Build Configuration: Create a build script or configuration file to define the build steps for your Angular app. This typically involves installing dependencies, running tests, and building the production-ready app bundle.

- [] Automated Testing: Include automated tests for both the frontend and backend. For Angular, you can use frameworks like Karma and Jasmine. For Django, you can leverage Django's built-in testing framework or third-party libraries like pytest.

- [] Artifact Generation: After a successful build, generate the artifact(s) required for deployment. In the case of an Angular app, this would be the production-ready app bundle.

- [] Deployment to Firebase: Configure your CI/CD pipeline to deploy the Angular app bundle to Firebase Hosting. This can be achieved using the Firebase CLI or by integrating with the Firebase REST API. Set up appropriate environment variables and security measures to protect sensitive information.

- [] Deployment to Hetzner: For the Django backend, configure your CI/CD pipeline to deploy the code to Hetzner Cloud. This typically involves setting up a virtual machine or container on Hetzner, installing the necessary dependencies, and deploying the Django application.

- [] Environment Configuration: Ensure that your CI/CD pipeline can handle environment-specific configuration, such as API keys, database credentials, and other settings. Store sensitive information securely using environment variables or secrets management tools provided by your CI/CD platform.

- [] Notifications and Monitoring: Set up notifications for build failures and successful deployments. Monitor the CI/CD pipeline and track metrics to identify and resolve issues promptly.

Remember to test your CI/CD pipeline thoroughly and iterate as needed to ensure a smooth and reliable deployment process. Documentation is also crucial to ensure that other team members can understand and contribute to the pipeline effectively.

By following these steps, you'll have a well-structured CI/CD pipeline in place for deploying your Angular app to Firebase and your Django backend to Hetzner.
